We cut out the unnecessary markup so you can enjoy elegance and unmatched purity every single day. Wear your jewelry. Live your life. We've got the purity covered.


Our Story & Mission: The Purity You Deserve
The Ganraj Vision
We are Ganraj Jewellers, and we are challenging the idea that purity must come at a premium. Our commitment is rooted in offering stunning, affordable silver jewelry for your everyday life—from a busy day at the office to a casual evening out.
The Spark: A Personal Connection
My name is Rutvik Bedre, and I started Ganraj Jewellers with a simple, yet powerful, belief: everyone deserves the confidence that comes with wearing genuine, pure silver.
For me, jewelry is more than just an accessory; it often holds the deepest memories. I remember the pieces that marked special occasions for my family, but I noticed how often we hesitated to wear them for fear of damage or loss.
This inspired a mission: to create and source exceptional silver jewelry—from unique designs to timeless classics—that you feel good about wearing daily. I personally connect with the process, ensuring every piece meets our strict standard of quality and purity.
What Makes Us Different? Purity & Affordability
We stand firmly behind the quality of our silver:
Purity First: We specialize in both durable S925 Sterling Silver and exceptional 999 Fine Silver, ensuring you receive a product of genuine, high quality.
For Every Budget: By controlling the making process ourselves and focusing on efficiency, we keep our prices accessible, allowing you to build your perfect collection without breaking the bank.
Daily Wear, Built to Last: Our jewelry is designed to be lived in. We focus on durable craftsmanship so you can wear your favorite pieces every day.
We welcome you to explore our collections and join the many young professionals and jewelry lovers who choose Ganraj for its unwavering commitment to purity and value.


My brand story
From Personal Memory to Ganraj Jewellers
My name is Rutvik Bedre, and the journey of Ganraj Jewellers began not with a business plan, but with a piece of jewelry that held deep emotional meaning for my family.
Like many, I grew up seeing beautiful silver pieces put away, tucked into velvet boxes, only to be worn on the rarest occasions. The pieces that carried the most sentimental value—gifts, heirlooms, tokens of love—were often deemed "too precious" for daily life. They were symbols of emotion, yet they remained locked away, their beauty and meaning unseen.
I realized that this common practice created a distance between people and the things they truly loved. Why should confidence, elegance, and quality only be reserved for special events?
The Commitment to Wearable Purity
This realization sparked the mission for Ganraj Jewellers: to bridge the gap between uncompromising purity and everyday wearability.
We became determined to handcraft and source silver jewelry—specializing in genuine 999 Fine Silver and S925 Sterling Silver—that was beautiful enough for a wedding but durable and affordable enough for a Monday morning.
The name 'Ganraj' represents the values we stand for: authenticity, strength, and unwavering quality.
Every piece we sell is a personal connection for me. It’s a promise to you that you can wear your jewelry, live your life, create new memories, and never have to worry about sacrificing quality or emptying your wallet.
We invite you to stop storing your joy away. Wear your purity every single day.
